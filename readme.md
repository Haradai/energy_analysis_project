# Project Kilowatt-Hours: Empowering Energy Efficiency

This repository contains the documentation and code for **Project Kilowatt-Hours: Empowering Energy Efficiency**. The project is part of the Synthesis Project I course in the Artificial Intelligence program at UAB, conducted in 2023.

## Challenge: High Energy Consumption

The university faces the challenge of excessive energy usage, resulting in inefficiency, wastage, and increased costs. This project aims to address these challenges by implementing sustainable energy practices and optimizing energy consumption within the university.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Minimize environmental impact through sustainable energy practices.
2. Reduce costs associated with energy usage.
3. Optimize energy consumption in the university.

## Approach

To achieve the project objectives, we will follow the following approach:

1. **Build a Predictive Model for Energy Consumption:** Gather historical energy consumption data and identify relevant inputs that have a significant impact on energy consumption.
2. **Train a Predictive Model:** Utilize deep learning algorithms to train a predictive model based on the identified inputs.
3. **Identify Key Inputs:** Determine the inputs with the highest impact on energy consumption and modify them to minimize energy usage.
4. **Continuously Refine and Test Scenarios:** Explore and test various scenarios using the predictive model to find the most effective energy-saving measures.
5. **Minimize Predicted Energy Consumption:** Analyze the results and insights obtained from the predictive model and develop an optimal strategy to minimize energy consumption.
6. **Propose an Optimal Strategy:** Based on the most effective energy-saving measures identified, propose an optimal strategy to be implemented within the university.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains historical energy consumption data used for training and testing the predictive model.
- `models/`: Includes the code and trained models for the predictive model.
- `analysis/`: Contains scripts and notebooks for analyzing the results and generating insights.
- `strategy/`: Contains the proposed optimal strategy based on the insights obtained from the analysis.
- `docs/`: Contains additional documentation, such as project requirements and project plan.
